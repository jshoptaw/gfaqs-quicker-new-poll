GameFAQs Quicker "New Poll"
======================================
Takes functionality of my <a href="http://guthub.com/jshoptaw/gfaqs-new-poll-link-in-topic-list">"New Poll" Link in Topic List</a> userscript (i.e. adding "New Poll" link on topic pages) and then also adds dynamic poll adding on the "New Topic" page. Instead of having the "add a poll" link force you to load a separate page, this script instead makes it add the "add a poll" form directly to the "New Topic" page, and vice versa to remove the form.

Use with one of the following browser extensions:

### Mozilla Firefox ###
*	[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
*	[Scriptish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptish/)

### Google Chrome ###
*	[Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
*	Convert script to Google Chrome extension:

	>1. Save the script (the `*.user.js` file) to your computer.
	>2. In Chrome, go to _Tools > Extensions_.
	>3. Drag/drop the user script file onto the _Extensions_ page.
